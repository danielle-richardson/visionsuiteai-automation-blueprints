</p>

**Challenge:** A growing B2B service business was manually researching Google Places for potential customers, spending 15+ hours weekly hunting for contact details. This led to inconsistent lead quality and limited growth potential.

**Solution:** I built an intelligent Google Places lead generation system using Make.com with AI enhancement. The system runs 24/7 completely hands-free, automatically finds prospects, enriches contact data, prevents duplicates, and delivers qualified leads to organized spreadsheets with zero manual work required.
