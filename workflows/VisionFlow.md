**Challenge:** Local businesses lose up to 50% of their new leads simply because they don't respond within the first 5 minutes. This translates to thousands of dollars in lost revenue every month from prospects who move on to faster competitors.

**Solution:** I built an intelligent speed-to-lead system using Make.com with AI-powered calling and SMS automation. The system responds to leads instantly with personalized SMS, follows up with AI phone calls for non-responders, and intelligently qualifies prospects using conversational AI. Complete TCPA compliance and 24/7 operation ensure zero leads are lost to slow response times.
